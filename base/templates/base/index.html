                    <h4>My FIrst Job as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>3 months after writing my first Hello World program on September 8th 2023 (While working in the marketing
                        department) I had convinced my boss to let me take a stab at building a better version of the outdated
                    laboratory management system my company was running on.</p>

                    <p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine. My newbie self was now in
                    charge of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients.</p>

                    <p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>As a developer, I have honed my skills in Python, machine learning, and R, allowing me to work on complex data-driven projects with confidence.
                        My expertise extends to FastAPI, enabling me to build efficient and scalable web APIs.
                        Additionally, I am proficient in NumPy and Pandas, which I utilize to perform advanced data manipulation, analysis, and preprocessing tasks.
                        These skills have equipped me to tackle diverse programming challenges and contribute effectively to various development projects.</p>

                    <p>I can learn just about anything by haveing a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code
                        where I need to figure out my things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>After almost two years of supporting my system at the lab I'm ready to learn something new. I'll
                        collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my blog "SayHelloWorld.co".
                    </p>
                    <p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of bigger team & 
                        learn from others with more experience than myself.
